Plan:

- Find out more about jquery
	- In what context does it function
	- What does it really do?
- How to build using jquery
	- How does the context matter in how you implement it
	- How DO you implement it?
	- Find 3 useful features, and write test code.
- Try out the test code, if time permits, try out more code.
	- I am more hands on, so writing the code itself would be more beneficial
	than just looking up how it works.


Strategies that worked:

Figuring out how it relates to what I already know
Making comparisons, finding similarities in how it works with things I already know
