Create class for game
Create attribute for word in initialize
Create attribute for guesses in initialize
Create attribute for letters in initialize

Create method in the class to check the word for specific letter.
	Make sure to split the word into a letter array in order to check.
If the letter is found, will print the letter, if it is not found will print the blank space
For the driver code, welcome the user to the game, and initialize a new instance.
Ask player one for a word, this word will be stored in the attribute we initialized earlier.
Create a loop, in which the user is asked for a letter, and  the letter is checked against the letters array using the class method.
The number of possible guesses will be equal to be equal to the length of the word.
After each guess increase guess amount by 1 
If after word.length guesses, player 2 has not guessed it print a taunting message.
If before or equal to world.length guess, player 2 figures out the word, print "Congratulations."
