# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version controls shows the history of revisions to one or more files, by an individual or by a team, and allows the merging of those revisions. It is useful for not only tracking changes, but also if there are problems, it allows you to roll back changes if necessary.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a fork off of the original master branch, that is used to work on separate features, without affecting the main branch. It is useful for working on individual features that can be merged when finished.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is basically a save point in git, when you add a file to be tracked/updated it git, it essentially keeps an eye on that file, but does not officially save it or commit it until you issue the commit command. A good commit message, concisely but clearly says what occured at that point, and what change you are commiting or saving.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a conflict caused by disagreeing changes between the versions of the file or files that you are attempting to merge.
