    <strong> Comments/Reflectsion </strong>
    <p><b> What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</b></p>
          <i> The purpose is to help with formatting both the page and the code, making both easier to follow. I find that section and nav are most useful because section allows you to break up the page in logical ways on a block-level, while nav helps organize the site as a whole and direct the user to where they need to go.</i>
    <p><b> What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</b> </p>
          <i> The html is read top to bottom </i>
    <p><b>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</b></p> 
          <i> I mostly just learned how to edit and create snippets. I think as I become more accustomed to coding, and know what I will need often, I will create more snippets as needed. </i>
    <p><b>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</b></p>
          <i> I really need to better memorize some of the block-level elements and what they do, some of it will be memorization, but also the more I do it, and use those, the better I will remember as well. </i>
